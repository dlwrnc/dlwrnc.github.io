        <h1>jackets.</h1>
        <p>In my spare time, I like to create custom denim jackets using dye, bleach, paint, metal studs and spikes, and various patches and fabrics.</p>

        <p>I wanted to use some of my mission patches for a jacket. I went for a grey jacket and gently bleached it to get the color lighter, so it would look a bit closer to the color of an American space suit. I didn't want to do a true white, since I felt that that would be too jarring with the spikes and the dark patches. The jacket layout, including the flag shoulder patch, was inspired by <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/air-space-magazine/sally-rides-jacket-180973156/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sally Ride's jacket</a>. <br><br> The large back patch is from 
            <a href="https://www.fennecdesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fennec Design</a>. The non-SpaceX mission patches were sourced from various places. The NASA Insight patch was a gift from a member of that team. The earthrise painting on the front was done with acrylic.</p>
        <h3>skeleton jacket.</h3>

        <p>This was a project for Halloween, and an idea that I'd had in my head for a while. I wanted to get sort of a spooky, glamrock look, partially inspired by 80s hair metal bands. This jacket has no patches, and is just spikes and acrylic paint. The acrylic was applied in layers to try to get more of an x-ray style look. I had to use a lot of reference photos for this one, as well as use a ruler to ensure the ribs were as even as possible. This jacket was originally a light blue color. I dyed it black using a mix of Rit Jet Black and Rit Sunshine Orange, which got it to a nice, rich black with no blue hues.</p>
        <h3>gift jacket.</h3>
        <div class="row">

                <img src="/images/a_front.png" alt="gift jacket front" style="width:100%">

        <p>This jacket was a gift for a friend, and is a bit more 'blank slate' than the rest so it can be added to by the new owner. The patches I pre-applied were specifically chosen for the person it was given to, and a few are actually vintage and were sourced from independent sellers. The front patch with the moon is also from Fennec Design. The back patch is actually a repurposed fabric wall hanging, because I was so taken with the design on it. On this jacket I continue the intentionally large, white stitches using embroidery thread to emphasize the DIY nature. This was originally a dark blue jacket, and was also dyed with Rit Jet Black and Rit Sunshine Orange.</p>
