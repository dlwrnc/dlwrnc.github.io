    <p><center>I wanted to use some of my mission patches. I went for a grey jacket and gently bleached it to try to capture a color similar to that of an American space suit. The jacket layout, including the flag shoulder patch, are inspired by the patches typically worn by astronauts. <br><br> The large back patch is from
