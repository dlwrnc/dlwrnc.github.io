    <h1>jackets.</h1>
        <p>In my spare time, I like to create custom denim jackets using dye, bleach, paint, metal studs and spikes, and various patches and fabrics.</p>
    <h3>space jacket.</h3>

        </div>

    <p>I wanted to use some of my mission patches for a jacket. I went for a grey jacket and gently bleached it to try to capture a color similar to that of an American space suit. The jacket layout, including the flag shoulder patch, are inspired by those typically worn by astronauts. <br><br> The large back patch is from 
    <a href="https://www.fennecdesign.com/">Fennec Design</a>. The non-SpaceX mission patches were sourced from various places. The NASA Insight patch was a gift from a member of that team. The earthrise painting on the front was done with acrylic.</p>
    <h3>skeleton jacket.</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div>
            <img src="/images/skeleton_front.png" alt="space jacket front" style="width:100%">
        </div>
        <div>
            <img src="/images/skeleton_back.png" alt="space jacket back" style="width:100%">

    <p>This was a project for Halloween, and an idea that I'd had in my head for a while. I wanted to get sort of a spooky, glamrock look, and used the band Kiss as reference for spike placement. This jacket has no patches, and is just spikes and acrylic paint. The acrylic was applied in layers to try to get more of an x-ray style look. I had to use a lot of reference photos for this one, as well as use a ruler to ensure the ribs were as even as possible. This jacket was originally a light blue color. I dyed it black using a mix of Rit Jet Black and Rit Sunshine Orange, which got it to a nice, rich black with no blue hues.</p>
