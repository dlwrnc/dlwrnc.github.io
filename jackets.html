    <h1>jackets.</h1>
        <p>In my spare time, I like to create custom denim jackets using dye, bleach, paint, metal studs and spikes, and various patches and fabrics.</p>

    <p>I wanted to use some of my mission patches for a jacket. I went for a grey jacket and gently bleached it to try to capture a color similar to that of an American space suit. The jacket layout, including the flag shoulder patch, are inspired by those typically worn by astronauts. <br><br> The large back patch is from 
    <a href="https://www.fennecdesign.com/">Fennec Design</a>. The non-SpaceX mission patches were sourced from various places. The NASA Insight patch was a gift from a member of that team. The earthrise painting on the front was done with acrylic.</p>
