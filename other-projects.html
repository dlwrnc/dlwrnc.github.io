        <h1>projects.</h1>
        <p>Some of my projects are tech-related, some are art-related, and some are a mix of both.</p><br><br><br>
        <p>I'm a published author in the field of presentation attack detection using AI. You can view the full conference proceedings <a href="https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~icprai18/ICPRAI%202018%20Proceedings.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, or download just my paper <a href="/resources/ICPRAI_2018_paper.pdf" download>here</a>.</p><br>
        <p>I have my <a href="https://github.com/dlwrnc/SpaceWeatherLamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">space weather lamp</a> on my github, which is a simple hardware/software project.</p><br>
        <p>In my spare time, I like to create custom denim <a href="jackets.html"> jackets</a> using dye, bleach, paint, metal studs and spikes, and various patches and fabrics.</p><br>
        <p>I make minecraft modpacks that modify in-game textures. I post these packs online for free download <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/blueshftt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. I use GIMP for image editing and custom texture painting. I primarily make packs that edit the in-game sky to use real-world telescope images. My most popular pack is a starry sky that features <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/starry-black-hole-sky/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a black hole</a>. The black hole is an image of the Andromeda galaxy that I heavily modified and repainted, and is overlaid on a custom starfield backdrop.</p><br>
        <p>I recently helped my friends Joe Barnard and Xyla Foxlin launch a Christmas tree rocket for their respective youtube channels. You can view Joe's video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKA1WtGXRPQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, and Xyla's video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo40R7-ZOQQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><br>
